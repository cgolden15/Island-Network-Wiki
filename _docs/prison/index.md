# Welcome to OP Prison!

Never played Asylum Cloud/The Island Network's OP Prison server before? No problem! This page will give you a brief overview of what to expect when you join the server. 

## Rank Progression

Like most servers, you will start as a rank "A" and work your way up to "Free". Once you reach free, you will be able to prestige and start the process over again. At certain prestige tiers you will unlock a new block in the same mine! After you reach prestige 100, and rank Z, you are able to reset! This will reset your prestige and rank, and you will gain 1 reset token to spend in the reset store.

## Mine Blocks

As you prestige, you will unlock new blocks in the mine. These blocks are worth more money than the previous blocks, and will help you progress through the ranks faster. The progression is listed here as well as in game at the mine.

- Default --> Coal Blocks
- Prestige 1 --> Iron Blocks
- Prestige 2 --> Redstone Blocks
- Prestige 3 --> Lapis Blocks
- Prestige 5 --> Gold Blocks
- Prestige 10 --> Quartz Blocks
- Prestige 15 --> Diamond Blocks
- Prestige 25 --> Emerald Blocks
- Prestige 50 --> Netherite Blocks
- Prestige 75 --> Amethyst Blocks
- Prestige 90 --> End Stone

## Custom Enchants

On the Island Network, we have a fully custom enchant system for everything from pickaxes to armor. You can view and buy the enchants in game by typing /ce while holding a tool! Some of the enchants include Token Booster, Keys, Auto repair and even up to Fortune 5000!
