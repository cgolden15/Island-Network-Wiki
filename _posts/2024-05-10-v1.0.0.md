## __Bug Fixes:__
- Mine loading percentage (shown in the Action Bar) is now 100% accurate and doesn't just display pre-set amounts.
- The loading speed of the Mine has DOUBLED in effiency! (~1.5s to load instead of the old ~3s) - This is also true for the Gang Mine.
- When the Mine is loading, you will no longer be teleported back when the Mine loading is completed. (Only had negative feedback from this - due to the optimization, it's no longer necessary!)
- The broadcast command has been fixed. It is still clickable for quick Plot access and advertisement! (Useful for when you have a Shop at your Plot!)
- LuckyBlocks now count towards your Blocks Mined.
- OmegaBlock reward messages now tell you what the reward was! (Finally, I know right? That Rex guy is so lazy, geesh)
- The "Entities will be removed in x" broadcast has been removed. Completely. (This function still exists, just not broadcasted anymore)
- Fixed the bug with being able to remove the "You won!" & "You lost!" coins from the eTokens gambling menus.
- Both the normal Mine and the Gang Mine have holograms showing the mines statistics.
- Fixed /mine not loading properly on the usage of the command itself. This was fixing itself when the mine reset, but was broken intially upon teleport.
